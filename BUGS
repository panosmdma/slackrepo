BUGS
----

This is relatively new software.  If that worries you, please run it on systems
that you can reinstall or restore from backups easily, eg. a VM or a clean
Slackware installation, or use the chroot and/or non-root building features.

As new features are added, the man pages will sometimes be out of date.

You can report bugs to me, David Spencer <baildon.research@googlemail.com>, or
open issues and pull requests on Github at https://github.com/idlemoor/slackrepo
