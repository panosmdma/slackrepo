slackrepo-0.2.0, May 2015

The following new features and improvements have been added since the release
of slackrepo-0.1.0 last year:

  * Building in a dynamically created and destroyed chroot environment to keep
    your system absolutely clean, to detect bad builds and to speed up package
    uninstalls (this feature requires Linux kernel version 3.18 or newer with
    overlayfs, for example Slackware -current)

  * Building as a non-root user to detect bad builds and keep your system
    clean (this feature requires the 'fakeroot' package, available from
    SlackBuilds.org) - see the FAQ

  * Automatic download fallback to Slackbuilds Direct Links if the original 
    download has gone down

  * On Slackware -current, the default is to build from Matteo Bernardini's
    forked SBo repository for slackware-current (--repo=ponce)

  * Build time estimates are shown, using a database of known build times, or
    the last occasion you successfully built the same package

  * Automatic package backup is performed, so you can go back to the previous
    build of a package

  * New 'lint' command allows you to test or retest SlackBuilds, source
    download links and package contents without building or rebuilding

  * Coloured output from cmake, git, clang, mono, waf and gcc-4.9 when you
    build with --verbose

  * Shell-style globs (wildcards) are now supported in the command arguments,
    so you can do things like
      slackrepo build 'xfce4-*-plugin'
    (As with commands like 'find', you will need to quote them or escape them,
    to protect them from the shell.)

  * System-supplied hintfiles have moved to the directory
      /etc/slackrepo/<repo>/default_hintfiles/<slackversion>
    and are now *enabled* by default. Your own local hintfiles override the
    default hintfiles, and are still read from the directory
      /etc/slackrepo/<repo>/hintfiles
    You can disable the default hintfiles by disabling the DEFAULT_HINTDIR
    configuration variable.

  * The SPECIAL hint has been renamed to PRAGMA (but SPECIAL is still accepted)

  * Revised and additional hintfiles Thanks to Panagiotis Nikolaou for the
    contributions!

  * sqlite database to track package revision info (the previous release of
    slackrepo used dotfiles)

  * Simplified --verbose option, --quiet option removed
