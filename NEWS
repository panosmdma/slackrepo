slackrepo-0.3, September 2017

The following new features and improvements have been added since the release
of slackrepo-0.2.0:

  * Default hintfiles have been moved to the slackrepo-hints package,
    so you now need both slackrepo and slackrepo-hints if you use the
    default hintfiles (recommended).

  * CPU, memory and disk space usage is recorded during builds. A summary is shown 
    on the console if the build takes more than five minutes, and a log is created
    in the log directory.

  * There are several dependency hint improvements and a new config file option.
    - the new SUBSTITUTE config file option allows you to set a global policy for
      replacing dependencies in all builds, for example:
        SUBSTITUTE="jdk => openjdk, jack_audio_connection_kit => jack2"
    - the new DELREQUIRES hint deletes a dependency (it's the opposite of ADDREQUIRES)
    - the new BUILDTIME hint deletes dependencies from the repository .dep file
      and slapt-get information
    - the new RUNTIME hint adds dependencies to the repository .dep file and slapt-get
      information

  * The new 'python3' pragma gives you a single easy way to force python3 support, 
    including SlackBuilds that automatically detect Python 3, SlackBuilds that need
    a PYTHON3 option, and even to add Python 3 support into SlackBuilds that do not
    support it. (Thanks to Jeremy Hansen.)

  * The new 'kernelmod' and 'kernel' pragmas enable automatic rebuilding of a package
    when the build system's kernel is upgraded.

  * The new 'x86arch' pragma sets the correct arch for 32 bit binary repack
    SlackBuilds.

  * The new 'curl' and 'wget' pragmas fake the user agent string when downloading.

  * If downloading from the normal URL fails, downloads now fall back to both
    sbosrcarch and Slackbuilds Direct Links.

  * The --chroot control argument now allows any specified chroot directory to
    be used (--chroot=/path/to/chroot). This can also be set as a default in
    the configuration file (CHROOT="/path/to/chroot").

  * The new --debug control argument is a quick way of setting
    --very-verbose --dry-run --lint --keep-tmp

  * Some warnings have been revised and new warnings have been added.

  * Warnings can be suppressed selectively for specific builds with the new
    'NOWARNING' hint.

  * The lint command and --lint control argument now accept suboptions for doing
    checks selectively.

  * Experimental support for reproducible builds has been added (set the config
    variable REPRODUCIBLE='y').


slackrepo-0.2.0, May 2015

The following new features and improvements have been added since the release
of slackrepo-0.1.0 last year:

  * Building in a dynamically created and destroyed chroot environment to keep
    your system absolutely clean, to detect bad builds and to speed up package
    uninstalls (this feature requires Linux kernel version 3.18 or newer with
    overlayfs, for example Slackware -current)

  * Building as a non-root user to detect bad builds and keep your system
    clean (this feature requires the 'fakeroot' package, available from
    SlackBuilds.org) - see the FAQ

  * Automatic download fallback to Slackbuilds Direct Links if the original
    download has gone down

  * On Slackware -current, the default is to build from Matteo Bernardini's
    forked SBo repository for slackware-current (--repo=ponce)

  * Build time estimates are shown, using a database of known build times, or
    the last occasion you successfully built the same package

  * Automatic package backup is performed, so you can go back to the previous
    build of a package

  * New 'lint' command allows you to test or retest SlackBuilds, source
    download links and package contents without building or rebuilding

  * Coloured output from cmake, git, clang, mono, waf and gcc-4.9 when you
    build with --verbose

  * Shell-style globs (wildcards) are now supported in the command arguments,
    so you can do things like
      slackrepo build 'xfce4-*-plugin'
    (As with commands like 'find', you will need to quote them or escape them,
    to protect them from the shell.)

  * System-supplied hintfiles have moved to the directory
      /etc/slackrepo/<repo>/default_hintfiles/<slackversion>
    and are now *enabled* by default. Your own local hintfiles override the
    default hintfiles, and are still read from the directory
      /etc/slackrepo/<repo>/hintfiles
    You can disable the default hintfiles by disabling the DEFAULT_HINTDIR
    configuration variable.

  * The SPECIAL hint has been renamed to PRAGMA (but SPECIAL is still accepted)

  * Revised and additional hintfiles, thanks to Panagiotis Nikolaou for the
    contributions!

  * sqlite database to track package revision info (the previous release of
    slackrepo used dotfiles)

  * Simplified --verbose option, --quiet option removed
