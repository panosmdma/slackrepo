# This is the slackrepo configuration file for the csb repository.
#
# The priority order for configuration is:
# (1) Environment variables when slackrepo is called
# (2) ~/.genreprc   [for gen_repos_files.sh only]
# (3) ~/.slackreporc
# (4) /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_csb.conf
#
# %REPO%, %SLACKVER% and %ARCH% will be replaced by the repo ID, Slackware version and arch

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filestore locations

# Where is the local SlackBuild repo:
SBREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/slackbuilds"

# Where to store cached sources (you will need plenty of space):
SRCREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/source"

# Where to store built packages (you will need plenty of space):
PKGREPO="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/packages/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%"

# Where to keep backups:
PKGBACKUP="/var/lib/slackrepo/%REPO%/backups/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%"
#  (remove this if you do not want to have backups)

# Where to find hintfiles for this repo:
HINTDIR="/etc/slackrepo/%REPO%/hintfiles"
DEFAULT_HINTDIR="/etc/slackrepo/%REPO%/default_hintfiles/%SLACKVER%"
#  (remove this if you do not want to use the default hints)

# Where to keep the database:

# If you want to run slackrepo as an ordinary user, you can remove or comment
# all the above definitions, and use something like this instead, and save it
# to .slackreporc in your ordinary user's home directory:
#
#   SBREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/slackbuilds
#   SRCREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/source
#   PKGREPO=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/packages/%SLACKVER%/%ARCH%

#   LOGDIR=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/logs
#   DATABASE=~/slackrepo/%REPO%/database_%REPO%.sqlite3

# (Note: if you use ~ you should NOT use quotes "...")

# Where to store temporary files (you will need plenty of space):
