.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ build
Builds packages from an input repository of SlackBuilds (for example,
a git clone of SlackBuilds.org), and then stores them in a package repository. 'add'
is accepted as a synonym of 'build'.
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ rebuild
Rebuilds packages that are already in the package repository.
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ update
Builds, rebuilds and removes packages in the package repository,
according to changes in the SlackBuild repository.
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ remove
Removes packages from the package repository.
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ revert
Moves packages from the backup repository into the package repository,
and packages from the package repository into the backup repository. 'restore'
is accepted as a synonym of 'revert'.
.
.TP
.B slackrepo\ lint
Performs quality tests on source download URLs and source files, SlackBuilds,
and packages.
.
.TP
.I ITEM
An item specifies
a directory or a SlackBuild file in the SlackBuild repository,
and/or (in the update, remove and revert commands only) formerly in the SlackBuild repository.
Shell-style globs (wildcards) are allowed.
If no items are specified, all directories in the SlackBuild repository are processed
(except in the remove and revert commands,
where it is mandatory to specify the items to be removed).
.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-\-repo=ID
Use the SlackBuild and package repository identified by ID.
The filestore locations of the SlackBuild and package repositories are defined in
the configuration file
.IR /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf ,
where ID is an identifier for the repositories.
The default repository ID is SBo.
For details, see
.BR slackrepo.conf(5) .
.
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
Builds and rebuilds will be performed, and removes and reverts will be checked, but no
changes will be made to the package repository. This option conflicts with --install.
This option has no effect with the lint command.
.
.TP
.B \-\-install
Built, rebuilt and updated packages will be installed on the host system.
This results in a \(dqqueue\(dq style build, and packages may not be 100% clean of
unexpected dependencies. The default is for packages
.B not
to be installed. This option conflicts with --dry-run, and has no effect with the
remove, revert and lint commands.
.
.TP
.B \-\-chroot
Construct and use a temporary chroot environment for each build process.
(Requires a Linux 3.18+ kernel with overlayfs.)
This option has no effect with the remove, revert and lint commands.
.
.TP
.B \-\-lint
With the build, rebuild and update commands, the source files and URLs, SlackBuild
files, and any built packages will be subjected to quality tests;
these tests are the same as the tests performed by the lint command.
With the remove, revert and lint commands, this option has no effect.
.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Display the output of each build process on the console during execution.
If --verbose or -v is specified multiple times, it is equivalent to --very-verbose.
.
.TP
.BR \-vv ", " \-\-very\-verbose
Forces
.B make
and
.B cmake
to produce more verbose compilation output
when it is called by a SlackBuild. This option implies --verbose.
.
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-tmp
Keep all temporary files in $TMP and $TMPDIR, for debugging purposes.
.
.TP
.B \-\-color=always|auto|no
Pass coloured output from cmake, clang, git, gcc-4.9, mono, waf etc. to standard output
if standard output is a terminal console (--color=auto),
or pass colour unconditionally (--color=always),
or do not pass colour (--color=no).
The default is --color=auto. The --color option is effective only if --verbose
is specified. '--colour' is accepted as a synonym of '--color'.
.
.TP
.B \-\-nice=N
Adjust the niceness of the build process by integer N.
The default is 5 (like distcc).
.
.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.
.B 0
all operations succeeded or only warnings were issued
.br
.B 1
one or more operations failed
.br
.B 2
the configuration file was not found
.br
.B 3
invocation usage error
.br
.B 4
internal error, please report a bug
.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
The behaviour of
.B slackrepo
is affected by the following environment variables:
.P
.BR REPO ", " CONFIGDIR ", " SBREPO ", " PKGREPO ", " PKGBACKUP ", " SRCREPO ,
.BR HINTDIR ", " DEFAULT_HINTDIR ", " LOGDIR ", " DATABASE ", " TMP ,
.BR NUMJOBS ", " ARCH ", " TAG ", " PKGTYPE ", " USE_GENREPOS
.P
Each of these environment variables overrides the corresponding configuration
variable in the file
.I /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf
or
.IR ~/.slackreporc .
For details, see
.BR slackrepo.conf (5).
.P
.B MAKEFLAGS
.P
The MAKEFLAGS variable is passed to each SlackBuild.  Its value will
be augmented by the value of NUMJOBS, so '-j' should not be specified in MAKEFLAGS.
.P
.B TMPDIR
.P
.B slackrepo
uses the directory specified by TMPDIR (default
.IR /tmp )
for its own temporary files.
(However, SlackBuilds use the directory specified by TMP, not TMPDIR.)
.P
.B VERBOSE  ", " VERY_VERBOSE ", " CHROOT ", " DRY_RUN ", " INSTALL ", " LINT ", " KEEP_TMP ", " COLOR ", " NICE
Each of these environment variables can be used to set the default for the corresponding control argument.
They override the corresponding configuration variables in the file
.I /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf
or
.IR ~/.slackreporc .
For details, see
.BR slackrepo.conf (5).
.P
.B SLACKREPO_COLORS
This environment variable can be used to customise slackrepo's colour palette.
The value is a string similar to LS_COLORS or GCC_COLORS. The default palette is
.P
.RS
.EX
SLACKREPO_COLORS="error=01;31:warning=01;35:success=01;32:important=01:normal=00:info=22;36:ok=00:build=22;32:skip=22;35:fail=22;31:updated=22;36"

.SH FILES
.
.TP 5
.I /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_SBo.conf
This file defines the configuration variables for the SBo repository; see
.BR slackrepo.conf (5).
.TP 5
.I ~/.slackreporc
This file can optionally be created to define the default repository ID
and override configuration variables set in
.IR /etc/slackrepo/slackrepo_ID.conf ;
see
.BR slackrepo.conf (5).
.TP 5
.I /etc/slackrepo/SBo/hintfiles
This directory contains the hintfiles for the SBo repository; see
.BR slackrepo.hint (5).
.
.
.
.SH NOTES
.
.P
For best results,
.B slackrepo
is intended to be run on a \(dqclean\(dq standard Slackware
environment (like a \(dqbuild box\(dq or a virtual machine), with a full installation
of Slackware and no additional packages (or very few). You can then use the
package repository to install the packages on other hosts (e.g. with
.BR slackpkg+ ).
.
.P
Packages are updated or rebuilt if required; for example, if a package is being
built, its dependencies will be updated and/or rebuilt if they are out-of-date.
A package is out-of-date if:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
the git revision in the directory containing the SlackBuild has changed since the package was built
.IP \(bu 4
the directory containing the SlackBuilds has untracked/uncommited files (i.e., \(dqgit is dirty\(dq) and they are newer than the package
.IP \(bu 4
any of its direct dependencies has been updated since the package was built
.IP \(bu 4
the hintfile has changed since the package was built
.IP \(bu 4
the version of Slackware has changed since the package was built
.RE
.P
Changes in the SlackBuilds directory are classified as
\(dqupdates\(dq, which will cause directly depending items to be rebuilt.
Other changes are classified as \(dqrebuilds\(dq and do not cause depending items to be rebuilt.
For example, ffmpeg depends on x264, and transcode depends on ffmpeg.
If x264 is updated, ffmpeg will be rebuilt, but transcode will not be rebuilt.
If x264 is rebuilt, ffmpeg will not be rebuilt.
If ffmpeg is updated, transcode will be rebuilt.
.
.P
When a package is rebuilt, and when a package is updated but its version
is unchanged, the BUILD number in the package repository is always incremented
(and the BUILD number in the SlackBuild file is ignored).
