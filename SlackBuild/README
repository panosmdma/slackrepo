slackrepo is a tool for making and managing package repositories on
Slackware, by building from repositories of SlackBuilds.

Features:
  - Package updates detected by tracking upstream git revisions
  - Clean repeatable building, including dependencies
  - Highly automated (no interaction required)
  - Output repositories suitable for use with slackpkg+


Optional runtime requirement

fakeroot is required if you want to build as a non-root user. You must also
edit the file /etc/sudoers.d/slackrepo -- replace "user1,user2,user3" with
a list of the users to authorize, and remove '#' from all three lines, so
that it looks something like this:

  User_Alias SLACKREPOERS = myuser
  Defaults:SLACKREPOERS !env_reset,!env_delete
  SLACKREPOERS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/libexec/slackrepo/*
