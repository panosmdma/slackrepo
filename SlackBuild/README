slackrepo is a tool for making and managing package repositories on
Slackware, by building from repositories of SlackBuilds.

Features:
  - Package updates detected by tracking upstream git revisions
  - Clean repeatable building, including dependencies
  - Highly automated (no interaction required)
  - Output repositories suitable for use with slackpkg+


Optional runtime requirement

fakeroot is required if you want to build as a non-root user. You must
also create the file /etc/sudoers.d/slackrepo containing these lines
(replacing "user1,user2,user3" with a list of the users to authorize):

  User_Alias SLACKREPOERS = user1,user2,user3
  Defaults:SLACKREPOERS !env_reset,!env_delete
  SLACKREPOERS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/libexec/slackrepo/*
